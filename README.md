# EV Charging Station Optimization in NYC
This project analyzes the spatial distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in New York City and provides recommendations for optimal new station placements based on underserved areas.

## Goal
As electric vehicles become more common, it's crucial to ensure charging infrastructure keeps pace with demand.  
This project simulates how a city planning team or energy company might use data science to:

- Analyze current EV charging station distribution across NYC  
- Identify underserved areas and demand gaps  
- Recommend optimal locations for **new station placement** based on accessibility, proximity, and density factors  

## Data Source
